# 🎥 Movie Recommender System

Welcome to the **Movie Recommender System**! This is a school project developed using Python, with a focus on movie recommendations using data science and machine learning techniques. The project leverages libraries like `pandas`, `scikit-learn`, and `Surprise` to provide personalized movie suggestions. 🎬

## 🌟 Features

- 📊 **Data Handling:** Utilizes `pandas` for data preprocessing and manipulation.
- 🤖 **Machine Learning:** Implements various algorithms using `scikit-learn` to recommend movies.
- 🎲 **Collaborative Filtering:** Uses the `Surprise` library to build a collaborative filtering recommender system.
- 📈 **Performance Evaluation:** Evaluates models using metrics like RMSE, precision, and recall.
